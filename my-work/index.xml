      <description>My very first sponsored project! The first part of the shoot is heavily inspired from product photography pages I see on Instagram with incredible setups so I attempted a DIY shoot with fake grass from my dad&amp;rsquo;s koi pond and his fishing line to suspend the armband! A few sprinkles of water later I got the shot and I guess that day &amp;lsquo;I could do anything&amp;rsquo; (TICDA hehe)
  The second part of the shoot was an outdoor shoot since the brand also focuses on fitness and health motivation.</description>

      <description>Yearbook shots in Indonesia tend to be on the extravagant side, and this class in particular was to have one whole page on the yearbook. We went with a rooftop shot with all 26 students with an extra shot for the guys and one for the girls.
