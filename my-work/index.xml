      <description>Private school high school yearbooks in Indonesia often differ quite a bit from the conventional yearbooks. Each student is to have a whole page spread of their name and photo&amp;ndash;and I got to shoot some for a couple students.
      These students&amp;rsquo; class also wanted to have one extra page for a class photo. We went with a rooftop shot with all 26 students.

      <description>My very first sponsored project! The first part of the shoot is heavily inspired from product photography pages I see on Instagram with incredible setups so I attempted a DIY shoot with fake grass from my dad&amp;rsquo;s koi pond and his fishing line to suspend the armband! A few sprinkles of water later I got the shot and I guess that day &amp;lsquo;I could do anything&amp;rsquo; (TICDA hehe)
    The second part of the shoot was an outdoor shoot since the brand also focuses on fitness and health motivation.</description>
