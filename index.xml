      <description>Day 1: Hahndorf, Grange Beach, Fleurieu Peninsula We started our trip with some brunch and coffee in Adelaide, which is obviously the best way to start an Australian day (I guess second to yum cha). Then we drove to the Hahndorf area, stopping by at Beerenberg to grab the iconic strawberry jam. (Warning: do not buy honey on the mainland if you&amp;rsquo;re planning to go to Kangaroo Island since bringing honey to the island is prohibited to preserve the existing Kangaroo Island honeyâ€”more on that later.</description>

      <description>Private school high school yearbooks in Indonesia often differ quite a bit from the conventional yearbooks. Each student is to have a whole page spread of their name and photo&amp;ndash;and I got to shoot some for a couple students.
      These students&amp;rsquo; class also wanted to have one extra page for a class photo. We went with a rooftop shot with all 26 students.

      <description>My very first sponsored project! The first part of the shoot is heavily inspired from product photography pages I see on Instagram with incredible setups so I attempted a DIY shoot with fake grass from my dad&amp;rsquo;s koi pond and his fishing line to suspend the armband! A few sprinkles of water later I got the shot and I guess that day &amp;lsquo;I could do anything&amp;rsquo; (TICDA hehe)
    The second part of the shoot was an outdoor shoot since the brand also focuses on fitness and health motivation.</description>
